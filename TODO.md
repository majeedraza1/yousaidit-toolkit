- [x] The popup message system only seems to work with cards which have been uploaded using the dashboard, so the other
  standard cards it doesn’t load the correct size.
    - e.g. working product – https://devp7.yousaidit.co.uk/product/new-test-card/
    - e.g. none working product - https://devp7.yousaidit.co.uk/product/no-need-to-read-this-the-
      moneys-in-the-card/
- [ ] On the inner message system for the standard cards it gives an error if the message is to
  short, can this be set to min of 1 characters? It’s the same for both the dyamic and standard
  on the shopping cart check/edit part
- [ ] Can the standard inner message system have the same design as the dyamic one please. So
  the spacing and everything the same.
