#### Bug List: Bugs 12-01-22.pdf

- [x] The popup message system only seems to work with cards which have been uploaded using the dashboard, so the other
  standard cards it doesn’t load the correct size.
    - e.g. working product – https://devp7.yousaidit.co.uk/product/new-test-card/
    - e.g. none working product - https://devp7.yousaidit.co.uk/product/no-need-to-read-this-the-
      moneys-in-the-card/
- [x] On the inner message system for the standard cards it gives an error if the message is too
  short, can this be set to min of 1 characters? It’s the same for both the dyamic and standard
  on the shopping cart check/edit part
- [ ] Can the standard inner message system have the same design as the dyamic one please. So
  the spacing and everything the same.
- [ ] The image uploader on the dyamic inner message system keeps thinking all images are adult
  content but there not.
- [x] Can we have the option to disable/enable the dynamic editor on the designer dashboard page
  please? I only want to enable it for myself and maybe a few others for now.
- [x] The 'generate image button' still doesn’t seem to merge the envelope backgrounds yet, I’ve
  asked our admin to add the code which has now been done.
  - It's just show background image and you need to save it manually.
- [x] When the 'generate image button' is working we would need this option added to the static
  cards
- [ ] On mobile the dynamic cards hide the remove from cart button -
- [ ] On the bottom on the pages it’s showing this for somereason -
- [ ] The Print Cards part on the site deson   deson’tt seem to work that great, when I click top button
  saying generate now it says it   it’s done so I got back to the print card page and merge the
  dynamic cards it doesn’tt seem to merge them.
  I done a test order, one dynamic and another static and its merging the dynamic cards with
  the static ones.
  I also have another dynamic order in shipstation and it   it’s merging it art work name - tttret   test (tetetet-22)
- [ ] Since we’ve added the 3mm bleed to our merge PDFs, the back of the card info needs to be
  moved to the right by 3mm. These parts
- [ ] I’m still not happy with the back logo res, it’s showing 170dpi we need this to be 300dpi. I
  can send you another logo what’s 300dpi.
